                We use a system that allows us to respond to high priority potholes by ranking them in severity from 1 to 3.
                In order to be classified as a severity 3
                pothole the minimum width is 12" and minimum length of 24" with a depth of 8" or more.
                The classification for a severity level 2 pothole is minimum width
                of 12", length 24" and depth of 4".
                Anything smaller is classed as a level 1 severity, although we also take
                into account the speed limit on the road and the location in regards to a vehicle passing over it.

                  What are the causes of Potholes?
                  </v-card-title>
              <v-card-text>
              There are several different causes of potholes from water damage to being worn out due to use.
              Poor drainage upon the road can lead to washing out of the base or cause ice to form which can expand creating voids
              and allowing water movement.
              Some potholes are caused via the asphalt becoming warn out over time or from direct impact damage. This can cause damage to your car and lead to you
              having to repair a flat tire. If your car has been damaged due to a pothole be sure to file a claim.

                  </v-card-title>
              <v-card-text>
              Repairs are scheduled based on the level of severity in which priority is given to high severity rated cases.
              The repairs are made by a number of different methods, these include:
              - 25 pound bags of pre-made cold patch asphalt mix, manually placed and compressed into the pothole.
              - Dump trucks containing a large quantity of cold mix is driven to the site and manually compressed into the pothole by our staff.
              Once the pothole has been repaired a staff member will mark the repair as being completed.
